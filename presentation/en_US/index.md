Around this core are added plugins that can be
all kinds :

-   home automation protocol (Z-Wave, RFXcom, EnOcean ...),

-   IP protocol (KNX, xPL ...),

-   communicating object (Nest, Netatmo ...),

-   high level (alarm, thermostat ...),

-   interface (widget),

-   organization (agenda, Google calendar),

-   development (script).

These plugins can be recovered via Market and can extend
the possibilities of Jeedom.

Jeedom allows any plugin to chat with another on a
standardized basis. This allows for example to use plugins
thermostat or alarm with any home automation protocol or even a
IP plugin or communicating object ...

Principle
===

Jeedom has the distinction of being without subscription and without cloud, which
ensures the operation of your home automation even if you
do not have internet anymore. This also guarantees the security of your data
(avoids the risk of mass piracy accounts).

The project being open and open source it also guarantees a strong
rate of evolution thanks to the many developers who participate.
