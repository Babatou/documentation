Skip the core to beta
======================

We must first pass Jeedom in beta. For that, check that
you are in expert mode, then Adminitration → Configuration → Mises à
day. In the **URL** tab, click **Enable URL**:

-   Jeedom core URL: <https://github.com/jeedom/core/archive/beta.zip>

-   Jeedom core version URL:
    <Https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeedom/core/beta/core/config/version>

Save and refresh the page. Still in the ** Mises à
day **, in **Source of update** select **URL**. He does not
remains to force an update of the core to pass on the
beta version of Jeedom.

> **Important**
>
> Jeedom only reports important beta updates in beta
> will often force the update of Jeedom to have the
> latest version, even if the update center does not offer you
> nothing.

> **Important**
>
> An update in beta can completely break your Jeedom and the
> make it irrecoverable. In case of trouble you will have NO SUPPORT, it
> will have to make your own way.

> **Important**

> The transition from a stable version to a beta version is risky (we do not

> correctly). The transition from a beta to a stable version is
> PROHIBITED, in fact, during such an operation, it is 100% sure that
> your Jeedom will be broken. It is not possible to make a return
> back by restoring a backup of a stable version. In case of
> worries, you will not benefit from ANY SUPPORT.

Skip plugins in beta
==========================

For that, you have to go to Market Jeedom and then to your
profile, part **My Profile**, check the box to access
plugins in beta.

Then, in your Jeedom, on plugin plugs, you should
see a button "install beta".

> **Important**
>
> Any plugin installed in beta prohibits full access to
> support, even if your problem does not concern this plugin.

> **Important**
>
> A stable version plugin may not work on a Jeedom beta.

> **Important**

> A beta plugin DOES NOT work on a stable Jeedom.

> Any request for beta support, or a concern
