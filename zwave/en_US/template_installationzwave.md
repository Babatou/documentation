Once the plugin is activated, you have access to its configuration. If you
use an official Jeedom Box (Mini, Mini +) please do not touch
the configuration, however you can enter a name in the field
"Z-wave server name" (here Jeebox), same thing if you're on a
DIY installation but without deported mode. Otherwise, the
configuration will be adapted according to your type of installation
(Remote mode, Openzwave, etc ...
