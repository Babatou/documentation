summary
------

\

The ZIP-PSM02-EU detector offers 4 different functions: detection of
movement, opening detection, temperature sensor and
brightness. It consists of two parts: a detector and a magnet.
They are designed to be placed on a door or window with
the magnet fixed on the part that opens and the detector on the part
fixed.

Opening the door or window will move the magnet away from
detector, which will trigger the detector that will send a Z-Wave signal
if the system is armed (this signal can be operated by a
siren or by a home automation box for example). This detector can be
used for security or automation. When the detector
is associated with security devices, it serves as a trigger
alerts by detecting changes in radiation levels
infrared or door / window opening. If a person moves in
the field of view of the detector or open a door / window, a signal
The radio is transmitted, which triggers an alarm to dissuade
intruder.

The detector can also be used in combination with a
Z-Wave controller for home automation uses, by detecting both
changes in the levels of infrared radiation (presence) or
door / window opening and changes in the level of
brightness. Thus, one can trigger a lighting during a detection
movement or door opening in the dark.

The detector will also go up the brightness and the temperature, either in
case of significant change, and whenever a movement or
open / close are detected. A Z-Wave controller (remote control,
dongle ...) is necessary to integrate this detector into your network
if you already have an existing network. \

\

Configuration
-------------

\

To configure the OpenZwave plugin and know how to put Jeedom in
inclusion refer to this
[Documentation] (https://jeedom.fr/doc/documentation/plugins/openzwave/fr_FR/openzwave.html).

\

> **Important**
>
> To put this module in inclusion mode you have to press 3 times on the
> inclusion button, according to its paper documentation.

\

![inclusion](../images/philio.pst02a/inclusion.jpg)

\

Once included you should get this:

\

\

### Orders

\

Once the module is recognized, the commands associated with the module will be
available.

\

![Commandes](../images/philio.pst02a/commandes.jpg)

\

Here is the list of orders:

\

-   Presence: this is the command that will trace a presence detection

-   Opening: it is the command that will remount a detection
    opening

-   Temperature: it is the command which allows to go up the
    temperature

-   Brightness: it is the command which makes it possible to raise the luminosity

-   Sabotage: it is the sabotage command (it is triggered in
    case of tearing)

-   Battery: it's the battery control

\

### Module configuration

\

> **Important**
>
> During a first inclusion always wake up the module just after
> inclusion.

\

Then if you want to configure the module accordingly
of your installation, you have to go through the button
"Configuration" of Jeedom's OpenZwave plugin.

\

![Configuration plugin Zwave](../images/plugin/bouton_configuration.jpg)

\

You will arrive on this page (after clicking on the tab
settings)

\

![Config1](../images/philio.pst02a/config1.jpg)

![Config2](../images/philio.pst02a/config2.jpg)

![Config3](../images/philio.pst02a/config3.jpg)

\

Parameter details:

\

-   2: Adjusts the signal sent to the modules in the group
    association 2

-   3: Adjusts the sensitivity of the presence sensor (0:
    disabled 99: max sensitivity)

-   4: Adjusts the brightness level from which the
    signal defined in parameter 2 will be sent to the modules associated with the
    group 2

-   5: operating mode (refer to the
    manufacturer's documentation) Recommended value: 8

-   6: multi-sensor operating mode (refer to the
    manufacturer's documentation) Recommended value: 4

-   7: Custom operating mode of the multi-sensor (refer to

-   release the tamper button and press it again

\

F.A.Q.
------

\

This module wakes up by pressing its tamper button.

\

This module is a battery module, the new configuration will be
taken into account at the next wakeup.

\

Important note
---------------

\

> **Important**
