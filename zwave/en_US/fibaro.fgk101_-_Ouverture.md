\

summary
------

\

This Z-Wave powered battery powered detector has a sensor
reed, a magnetically operated proximity switch, which
detect the opening of a door or window when
two elements are far apart.

The device consists of a part with a magnet (the part
movable), fixed on the door or window, as well as the unit
main position on the fixed part of the window / door with
screw or an adhesive. When the two parties are no longer in front, a
Z-Wave radio signal is automatically sent.

In addition, this detector has an analog input allowing
connect a 1-Wire DS18B20 temperature probe. This detector has
also a wired input, so it can be used as a
universal transmitter: leave out its magnetic contact, and
connect its screw inputs to any detector (normally closed) of your
choice such as a smoke, gas or carbon monoxide detector,
etc.

A Z-Wave controller (remote control, dongle ...) is necessary in order
to integrate this detector into your network if you already have a network
existing.

Configuration
-------------

\

To configure the OpenZwave plugin and know how to put Jeedom in
inclusion refer to this

    drums

\

You can hide or show these commands as you wish.

\

### Module configuration

\

\

Parameter details:

\

-   Wakeup: this is the wakeup interval of the module (value
    recommended 7200)

-   1: Set the alarm cancellation time for the IN input
    (dry contact)

-   2: allows you to choose whether the blue led should blink on opening and
    closing your door for example

-   3: defines the contact type connected to the terminal block (IN)

-   5: Do not change this setting unless you know why
    (defines the type of signal sent to association group 1)

-   7: value sent to association group 1

-   9: Set the sending of the cancel signal between the IN input
    and the association group 1

-   12: Adjusts the sensitivity to the temperature change (if
    a 1-wire probe is connected to the module)

-   13: Set the broadcast mode send of the broadcast signals
    temperature and tamper

-   14: Activate the scene activation feature

\

\

Wakeup
------

\

To wake up this module there is only one way to proceed:

-   press the inclusion button 3/4 times. It may be necessary
    to do it several times in a row (2 or 3)

\

F.A.Q.
------

\

This module wakes up by pressing 3 times on one of the tamper buttons. But
the other tamper button must be depressed.

\

This module has a very small scope. It is advisable to do
inclusion in the closest to your box.

\

This module is a battery module, the new configuration will be
taken into account at the next wakeup.

\

Important note
---------------

\

> **Important**
>
> You have to wake up the module: after its inclusion, after a change
> of the configuration, after a wakeup change, after a
> change of association groups
